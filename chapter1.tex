\section{Problem Definition- Supervised Classification}

-Kernel Trick
-Approximate Neared Neighbors
-Hamming Distance
Locality-sensitive hashing

\section{Question To Be Answered} 

-Many top image classification algorithms today use neural networks for training filters and use hashing tricks in order to estimate hamming distances when the dataset has alot of samples and classes.

-Can we skip neural networks entirely and rather use a network of hashmaps to create the same filters and generate the same results? Computationaly simple memory based methods
